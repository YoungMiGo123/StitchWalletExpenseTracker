Step 1: Clone the repo 

Step 2: Open the expense wallet solution (You will need visual studio community, or other variants of visual studio for this)

Step 3: Ensure that the green start up project is set to Expense wallet. 
You can do this by right clicking on the expense wallet web solution and set it as startup (If it is not already set)

Step 4: Ensure that the green start  up  button is set to ExpenseWallet and not IIS express. 
If it is set to IIS express, please change it by clicking on the drop down next to it. Otherwise the solution won't run correctly.

Step 5: Click the green start up button that says ExpenseWallet. This will open up a new browser (By default Chrome) and follow the prompts



TESTS:

If you would like to run the unit tests, you can right click on the ExpenseWalletTests and select run tests.
